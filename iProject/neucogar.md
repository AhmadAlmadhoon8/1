#Neurobiologically inspired system project

The ultimate goal of the laboratory should be the artificial consciousness.
This is called "hard problem" and involves several cross-disciplinary research fields from Cognitive Science (cognitive hexagon): Neuroscience, Psychology, Philosophy, Anthropology and Sociology.
For this purposes the group of international scientists was created that includes: neuro-scientist, psychologist, philosopher and specialists from AI domain.

##Approach

In the domain presented above there are several possible directions. First of all most obvious direct mapping of the psychological and/or philosophical models in to the computational system this was done in implementations of several cognitive architectures. But, main disadvantage of strait mapping leads to miss low level details that could be crucial for implementation of machine consciousness.

The other way could be the creation of uniform theory of complex phenomena like: emotions, awareness, learning, anticipation or subjective experience that could run through perspectives: philosophical, psychological, neurobiological:

Based on this theory the phenomena could be recreated starting from lowest level of cellular mechanisms rebuilding all the phenomena in the other perspectives.
This approach demands new holistic and functional ways to deal with complex problems to maintain overall picture and functions that implements phenomena of overall picture and have low level mechanisms taken in account in the same time. ...

On the other hand the view on recreation of psychological and philosophical phenomena in a computational system puts us in front of perspective of definition of new domains in computer science:

##Ubique method

It is quite common to use functional decomposition method to deal with the complex problems, but we see one problem of this approach that are widely used in modern research. Dealing with low-level details researches usually loose overall picture high-level goals. In contrast dealing with only high-level descriptions lead to implementation of inadequate models in computational systems, that was mentioned above. To avoid both situations we proposed bidirectional approach that should take in account both functional decomposition and holistic view on the complex problem like: 'hard problem' of machine consciousness, machine perception, machine self-awareness, subjective experience. This method could be described like: **Imagine 1 neuron -> cortical column ~ 10 000 neurons -> Brodmann area (V1) 140 million -> Cortex 19 - 23 billions -> Whole brain 86 billions (10^14â€“10^15 Synapses)**
