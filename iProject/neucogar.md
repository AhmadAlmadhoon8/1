#Neurobiologically inspired system project

The ultimate goal of the laboratory should be the artificial consciousness.
This is called "hard problem" and involves several cross-disciplinary research fields from Cognitive Science (cognitive hexagon): Neuroscience, Psychology, Philosophy, Anthropology and Sociology.
For this purposes the group of international scientists was created that includes: neuro-scientist, psychologist, philosopher and specialists from AI domain.

##Approach

In the domain presented above there are several possible directions. First of all most obvious direct mapping of the psychological and/or philosophical models in to the computational system this was done in implementations of several cognitive architectures. But, main disadvantage of strait mapping leads to miss low level details that could be crucial for implementation of machine consciousness.
