# Documenting architecture

## Methodologies

### Waterfall

The waterfall model shows a process, where developers are to follow these phases in order:

1. Requirements specification (Requirements analysis)
1. Software design
1. Implementation and Integration
1. Testing (or Validation)
1. Deployment (or Installation)
1. Maintenance

### Agile

#### Agile manifesto

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Working software over comprehensive documentation

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Responding to change over following a plan


Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
Working software is the principal measure of progress
Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
Self-organizing teams
Regular adaptation to changing circumstances
