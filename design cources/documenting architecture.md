## Methodologies

### Waterfall

The waterfall model shows a process, where developers are to follow these phases in order:

1. Requirements specification (Requirements analysis)
1. Software design
1. Implementation and Integration
1. Testing (or Validation)
1. Deployment (or Installation)
1. Maintenance

### Agile

#### Agile manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

The Agile Manifesto is based on twelve principles:

1. Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software
1. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
1. Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
1. Working software is the principal measure of progress
1. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
1. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
1. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
1. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
1. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
1. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
1. Self-organizing teams
1. Regular adaptation to changing circumstances

### Agile-Scrum

####Repetitive activities:

1. Daily scrum - standup meeting, very important for common view 
1. Sprint backlog - is created on weekly basis based on user story. 
1. Retrospective - week review
1. Planing

#### Principles

1. Team of equals
1. Team responsibility 
1. Requirements are not set in stone
1. Customers are team members
