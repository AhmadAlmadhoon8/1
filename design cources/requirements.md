### Vision

A Vision Document is a software process document that describes the overall 'vision', or plan, for a particular piece of software. It defines the *stakeholders view* of the product to be developed, *specified in terms of the stakeholders key needs and features*. Containing an outline of the envisioned core requirements, it provides the contractual basis for the more detailed technical requirements. It is much shorter and more general than a product requirements document or a marketing requirements document, which outline the specific product plan and marketing plan respectively.
