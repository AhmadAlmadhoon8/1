## Business requirements   

[Definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_requirements)

Business requirements are *what* must be delivered to provide value. Products, systems, software, and processes are the ways how to deliver, satisfy, or meet the business requirements whats. Consequently, the topic of business requirements often arises in the context of developing or procuring software or other system; but business requirements exist much more broadly. That is, 'business' can be at work or personal, for profit or non-profit.

1. Business context, scope, and background, including reasons for change
1. Key business stakeholders that have requirements
1. Success factors for a future/target state
1. Constraints imposed by the business or other systems
1. Business process models and analysis, often using flowchart notations to depict ether 'as-is' and 'to-be' business processes
1. Logical data model and data dictionary references
1. Glossaries of business terms and local jargon
1. Data flow diagrams to illustrate how data flows through the information systems (different from flowcharts depicting algorithmic flow of business activities)


### Vision

[Definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_document)

A Vision Document is a software process document that describes the overall 'vision', or plan, for a particular piece of software. It defines the *stakeholders view* of the product to be developed, *specified in terms of the stakeholders key needs and features*. Containing an outline of the envisioned core requirements, it provides the contractual basis for the more detailed technical requirements. It is much shorter and more general than a product requirements document or a marketing requirements document, which outline the specific product plan and marketing plan respectively.

1. Introduction
1. Business Needs/Requirements
1. Product/Solution Overview
1. Major Features (Optional)
1. Scope & Limitations
1. Other Needs

## User requirements

[Definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_requirements_document)

The user requirement(s) document (URD) or user requirement(s) specification is a document usually used in software engineering that specifies the requirements the *user expects from software* to be constructed in a software project.
An important and difficult step of designing a software product is determining what the customer actually wants it to do.

## Functional requirements

In software engineering (and System Engineering), a functional requirement defines a function of a system or its component. A function is described as a *set of inputs, the behavior, and outputs*.

A typical functional requirement will contain a unique name and number, a brief summary, and a rationale. 

## Non functional requirements 

[Definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Functional_Requirements)

In systems engineering and requirements engineering, a non-functional requirement is a requirement that specifies *criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system*, rather than specific behaviors.

### Examples

1. Accessibility
1. Documentation
1. Performance / response time (performance engineering)
1. Reliability (e.g. mean time between failures - MTBF)
1. Security
