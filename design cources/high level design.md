## Definition

[Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_level_design)

High-level design provides an overview of an entire system, identifying all its elements at some level of abstraction.

Design overview - As proceeds the need is to provide an overview of how the various sub-systems and components of the system fit together.

The idea is to mention every work area briefly, clearly delegating the ownership of more detailed design activity whilst also encouraging effective collaboration between the various project teams.
