The bidirectional propagated wave RF communication between the MCU and the BPBs is established through a dipole antenna (Figure 18.5). This link operates at a frequency in the band 100 to 500 MHz, using quad-phase modulation with a 5-MHz bandwidth. The BPB communication module includes a crystal-controlled transmitter, receiver, and digital processing unit that synchronizes with and processes the MCU transmissions. The digital processing unit in the BPB also corrects small numbers of errors in the received data, decodes the MCU commands, and generates the responses to the MCU, including the reporting of higher numbers of communication errors that cannot be mathematically corrected. In this latter situation, the MCU would resend the message.
