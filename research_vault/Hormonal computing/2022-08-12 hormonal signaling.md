# Hormonal signaling

[Introductory animal physiology](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/animalphysiology/chapter/9-2/)

![The illustration shows four forms of chemical signaling. In autocrine signaling, a cell targets itself. In signaling across a gap junction, a cell targets a cell connected via gap junctions. In paracrine signaling, a cell targets a nearby cell. In endocrine signaling, a cell targets a distant cell via the bloodstream](https://cnx.org/resources/46ef3ef0e8ccae469cbdb28a48cb054c002522b5/Figure_09_01_01.jpg)

Â Paracrine signaling acts on nearby cells, endocrine signaling uses the circulatory system to transport ligands, and autocrine signaling acts on the signaling cell. Signaling via gap junctions involves signaling molecules moving directly between adjacent cells.
