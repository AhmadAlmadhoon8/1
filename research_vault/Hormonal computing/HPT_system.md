# Hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid (HPT) axis signaling

Possibly brightest example of the hormonal messaging and regulation is the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis [ref to fig].
Starting from the activation in hypothalamus where the thyroid release hormone (TRH) is produced??? it activates via neuro-messaging??? the release of the thyroid stimulation hormone (TSH) in pituitary gland that in its turn through the hormonal messaging thyroid gland that produces??? thyroid hormones that influences the set of organs.
The thyroid gland has negative feedback loop using ... messaging to pituitary gland and hypothalamus.

The implementation with the proposed approach could look like following:
(1) hypothalamus neurons forming TRH nucleus start spiking in the form described in Equation 1, their levels $L$ forms the output signal in the fiber from hypothalamus to the pituitary gland (Eq. 2). The pituitary gland start producing the TSH process staring from the membrane reaching the threshold (Eq. 1) [check].
