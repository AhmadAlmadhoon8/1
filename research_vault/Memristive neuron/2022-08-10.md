# Memristive neuron
## Report and article

Pictures 10 and 11 looks the same 
We could not get the too low resistance and we got optimal resistance
[+] We need to run the experiment in the lab with resistor 
There is the range where the memristors generate pattern 
[+] State of the art to the article
[+] Implement the resistor experiment
[+] Model and understand the discretion level when it is not possible to form the pattern.

There is no coordinates on 2-6 figures
