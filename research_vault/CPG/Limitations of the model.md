## Now currents speed is taken in account
these centres is provided by the persistent (slowly inactivating) sodium current (INaP)ineachneuron (known to be present in the rodent spinal neurons; see Zhong et al. 2007; Tazerart et al. 2008; Ziskind-Conhaim et al. 2008; Brocard et al. 2010, 2013)

## Single compartment models
All neurons were simulated in the Hodgkinâ€“Huxley style as single-compartment models.

Each RG-F subpopulation in the model contained 100 neurons; each CIN population had 50 neurons.

## Distribution of parameters as random normal 

## Equal split of subpopulations 
Each RG-F centre is split into two equal subpopulations,
