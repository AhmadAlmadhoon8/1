I have spent 8 years as engineer in one big IT company with specialization on infrastructure as a service.
What is infrastructure as a service?
Imagine big industrial company, for example the car plant, with something like 5000 employees,
almost all of them have a computer
and someone had to maintain this infrastructure.
There are companies that provide the infrastructure
as service. Like the shoemaker's children go barefoot we can not do the automation of these frequently
primitive cases. My favorite is: "Please install new version of Firefox".
In 2005 I have hit the article by MIT professor Henry Lieberman and Hugo Liu: "Feasibility studies for programming in natural languages". It was the description of an approach to generate the code on Python based on Natural language description (English), it was implemented in program called "Metafor".
The idea was quite strait-forward: why don't we use similar approach to solve the incidents in infrastructure as service domain?

I have started what they call "On bench project" menta (please see sites). We used set of technologies available
at the moment:

1. Natural language processing
1. Probabilistic reasoning servers
1. Genetic algorithms to generate new constructs

After one year we have managed to
demonstrate some progress in the automation but still the system was:

* too fragile
* had redundant and restrictive rules
* was unable to self-develop

So we had to use different approach: the neurobiologically inspired:

Machine cognition -> Machine consciousness -> Machine emotions
