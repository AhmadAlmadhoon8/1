I have spent 8 years as engineer in one big company and they have had the problem.
Imagine one industrial company with something like 5000 employees, almost all of them have a computer
and someone had to maintain this infrastructure.
There are companies that provide the infrastructure
as service. Like the shoemaker's children go barefoot we can not do the automation of these frequently
primitive cases. My favorite is: "Please install new version of Firefox".
I have started what they call "On bench project" menta (please see sites). After one year we have managed to demonstrate
some progress in the automation but still the system was:

* too fragile
* had redundant and restrictive rules
* was unable to self-develop

So we had to use different approach: the neurobiologically inspired:

Machine cognition -> Machine consciousness -> Machine emotions
