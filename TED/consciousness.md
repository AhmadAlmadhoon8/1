During 2014 I have created several science popular publications in Russian popular resource
postnauka.ru and they were included in the project "Robot Thoughts" http://postnauka.ru/specials/robothoughts.

In may 2015 I took part in the robotic event oriented mainly to kids: http://робостанция.рф/ with the speech regarding the consciousness of a robot.

My interview regarding emotional robots was published on forbers.ru:
