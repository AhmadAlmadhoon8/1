Once I have spent two month in business trip in the UK, at that time I was working for Fujitsu UK in the integration project. The team was so freindly and efficient that made the project and team work a real pleasure.
At the end of my trip that was in middle of Autumn the team members invited me to farewell dinner in the Chinese restaurant.
In the middle of the dinner the personnel of the restaurant dimmed the light and waitress with the cake with one candle started her trip to the lucky guy. As my birthday is in Spring and I knew that I was completely astonished when the waitress put the cake in front of me. The only phrase that I could say for a next minute was: "It is not my birthday".
And whole the restaurant laughed. My colleagues that organized the farewell party told me a bit later:
"This is something to remember".
