#TED application

##Tell us about yourself

We take this portion of the application very seriously. Please take the time to answer the questions thoughtfully and with plenty of detail, to help us understand who you are.

All responses are limited to 1500 characters except where noted.
###Tell us about your work, and the projects you are currently working on! *

[Work](work.md)

###What is your idea worth spreading? *


###What are you best known for? What is your crowning achievement? *


###What other accomplishments would you like to share? Please give context! (e.g. you're a wine expert, you own a bakery, etc.)

###List any awards, prizes or other Fellowships you have won, with the details below:

    The name of the award, prize or Fellowship
    The date it was received
    Any necessary context about the honor (e.g., "major math prize in Eastern Europe")

###What type of education have you received? Please add details for any degrees, including:

    Educational institution
    Type of degree
    Subject
    Dates completed
    Any additional context

###What hobbies, causes or activities are you passionate about aside from your work? *

###Share an example of something you have been a part of, created, led, or joined that you consider unique. Why do you think it is groundbreaking? *

###What questions should we have asked, but didn’t? Please write them down and answer them! (In other words, tell us something about yourself that we don’t know yet.) *
(Limit 2250 characters)

###Can you share a memorable anecdote from your life that will give us a further sense of what makes you tick? *

###How did you hear about the TED Fellows program? If you can, share the specific person, organization, etc.

###Have you participated in TED before? If so, to what extent? (e.g. you watch TED Talks, you’ve attended / hosted / spoken at a TEDx event, you’re a TED Translator, etc.)


List at least one website (more if you like!) that will help us understand you better.
Good examples include: your blog, your company's website, press coverage of your work, your portfolio, research examples, photos, etc. Less helpful are links to your Facebook or LinkedIn, but if you wish to share, make sure the profile is public.
