Now I do the research in machine consciousness that is mandatory part of the machine cognition and I'm the head of
the Machine Cognition lab in KFU(Kazan Federal University). There is group of scientists from 5 countries that work with me
including the philosopher, neuro-scientist and psychologist.

Our main goal, someone could call it long term, is to provide the basic understanding of the machine consciousness
phenomena. We understand that this is lifetime work and demands concentration of all our intellectual abilities.
I guess this complexity is what attracts most members of our group to this problem.

There are several directions that worth to mention:
Simulation of the basic (inborn emotional reactions) in a machine, This includes the simulation of the neurobiological processes
that forms the emotional state. We have payed special attention to the neuropsychological connections to ...

We are doing computational neurobiology collaborating with neuroscientists.
We have started the book about the machine consciousness mainly as the neural correlate
to several mental activities, in other words: explaining philosophical/psychological phenomena in neurobiological terms.
