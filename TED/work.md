Now I do the research in machine consciousness that is mandatory part of the machine cognition and I'm the head of
the Machine Cognition lab in KFU(Kazan Federal University). There is group of scientists from 5 countries that work with me
including the philosopher, neuro-scientist and psychologist.

Our main goal, someone could call it long term, is to provide the basic understanding of the machine consciousness
phenomena. We understand that this is lifetime work and demands concentration of all our intellectual abilities.
I guess this complexity is what attracts most members of our group to this problem.

There are several directions that worth to mention:

Simulation of the basic (inborn emotional reactions) in a machine, This includes the simulation of the neurobiological processes
that forms the emotional state. We have payed special attention to the neuropsychological nature of emotions on new generation
of neural networks (realistic). Our idea was to use as much as possible close to nature mechanisms to gain an option to draw
an analogy to the neurobiological experiments. 

In close collaboration with neuroscientists we do computational neurobiological research with main goal to build the connectome of cortical
column of a rat. This research is interesting from both medical: treatment of birth defects and AI: to build the realistic cortical column
computational function.
