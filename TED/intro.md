#Introduction

##I was born in childhood

Do you really need this ?
When I was 12 year old my mind was enormously influenced by the stories of my grand pa about the astrophysics.
Whole world expanded from building and streets to the galaxies and universe.
I still can remember the image of the trolleybus shrinking to the size of point of a needle.


##Problem

I had a problem and the problem was big and ubiquitous: I had too many ideas per day.
My colleagues in big company Fujitsu usually told me that no one needs my ideas and it is only me
who is interested in them. I was depressed: I could not self-realize all attempts seems to lead to
no result. I have started [blogging](https://cosmicdustman.wordpress.com/category/rd/) expressing the
ides just in the internet space like radiating them. Then I have understood that radiating ides does
not make much sense without the implementation. So I decided to gain some focus and that was the Machine
Consciousness.

I have spent 8 years as engineer in GDC Fujitsu Russia. They have the problem:
Imagine one industrial company with something like 5000 employees, almost all of them have a computer
and someone has to maintain this infrastructure. So there are companies that provide the infrastructure
as service. Like the shoemaker's children go barefoot we can not do the programming of these frequently
primitive cases. My favorite: "Please install new version of Firefox".


And there was a problem: 50 full time engineers with bachelor and master degrees were busy with solving, what
they call incidents (short description of what is wrong with customers computer).
