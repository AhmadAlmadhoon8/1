#Introduction

##I was born in childhood
When I was 12 year old my mind was enormously influenced by the stories of my grand pa about the astrophysics.
Whole world expanded from building and streets to the galaxies and universe.
I still can remember the image of the trolleybus shrinking to the size of point of a needle.
