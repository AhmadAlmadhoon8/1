"
1.	 Integrate And Fire Neurons. (14 MB)
Describes the integrate-and-fire neural model and how to use it in AnimatLab.
 	 
2.	 Spiking Chemical Synapses. (11 MB)
Spiking chemical synapses can be used to connect the integrate-and-fire neurons of the realistic neural module. It simulates a standard synapse that releases transmitter when the pre-synaptic neuron spikes.
 	 
3.	 Normal Firing Rate Neuron. (21 MB)
Firing rate neurons are a more abstract representation of neurons. The firing frequency is proportional to the membrane voltage. This tutorial describe the properties of this model.
 	 
Finally, these tutorials describe some of the basics you will need to build the bodies of your organisms. This will allow you complete the sensory-motor feedback loop by simulating both the neural and biomechanical components of a behavior.

1.	Hinge. (18 MB, 13 Minutes)
Shows you how to use the hinge, and walks you through creating a simple pendulum and verifying its period. It also shows how to change the behavior of the joint limits to make them springier or more damped.
 	 
2.	Muscle. (41 MB, 27 Minutes)
Demonstrates how the muscle model works, what its properties are, and how to use it.
 	 
3.	Stretch Receptor. (22 MB, 14 Minutes)
Shows how the stretch receptor model works, what its properties are, and how to use it.
 	 
4.	 Joint Angle. (18 MB, 18 Minutes)
This tutorial demonstrates how to use joint angle information in your neural networks."
