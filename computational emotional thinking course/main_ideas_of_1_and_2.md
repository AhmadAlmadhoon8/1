#Main ideas of Intro and Artificial and natural intelligence in one practical example

##Intro

1. AI is a challenge.
1. There is revolution now going in AI (see: NeuroGrid, SyNAPSE projects).
1. We do not create programs that are capable of living or social collaboration.
1. Our programs do not evolve ...
1. Currently we do not have enough computing power to build SNN similar to human brain.

##Artificial and natural intelligence in one practical example

1. Problems of GOFAI approaches:
  2. Fragile:
    3. NLP crashes
	3. Reasoner even probabilistic not flexible enough
  2. Not capable of thinking
  2. Grammar correctness dependent
  2. Requires artificial rules
1. One of possibly mandatory approach in training is childhood.
