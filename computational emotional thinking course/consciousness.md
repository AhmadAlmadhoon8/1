#Consciousness

##Marvin Minsky and Aaron Sloman

###What is Consciousness?

Sri Chinmoy 2003: "Consciousness is the inner spark or inner link in us, the golden link within us that connects our highest and most illumined part with our lowest and most unillumined part."

Some philosophers even insist that no one has better ideas about this.

Jerry Fodor 1992: "Nobody has the slightest idea how anything material could be conscious. Nobody even knows what it would be like to have the slightest idea about how anything material could be conscious. So much for the philosophy of consciousness."

For, consciousness is one of those suitcase-like words that we use for many types of processes, and for different kinds of purposes. It’s the same for most of our other words about minds, such as awareness, sentience, or intelligence.

Thinker 1: Consciousness is what binds all our mental events together, and thus unifies our present, past, and future into our continuous sense of experience. 

Thinker 2: Consciousness makes us "aware" of ourselves, and gives us our sense of identity; it is what animates our minds and gives us our sense of being alive. 

Thinker 3: Consciousness is what gives things meaning to us; without it, we would not even know we had feelings.

##Unpacking the Suitcase of Consciousness

Aaron Sloman 1994: "It is not worth asking how to define consciousness, how to explain it, how it evolved, what its function is, etc., because there’s no one thing for which all the answers would be the same. Instead, we have many sub-capabilities, for which the answers are different: e.g., different kinds of perception, learning, knowledge, attention control, self-monitoring, self-control, etc."

###Everyday example

Joan is starting to cross the street on the way to deliver her finished report. While thinking about what to say at the meeting, she hears a sound and turns her head—and sees a quickly oncoming car. Uncertain as to whether to cross or retreat, but uneasy about arriving late, Joan decides to sprint across the road. She later remembers her injured knee and reflects upon her impulsive decision. "If my knee had failed, I could have been killed. Then what would my friends have thought of me?"

* **Reaction**: Joan reacted quickly to that sound.
* **Identification**: She recognized it as being a sound.
* **Specification**: She classified it as the sound of a car.
* **Attention**: She noticed certain things rather than others.
* **Indecision**: She wondered whether to cross or retreat.
* **Imagining**: She envisioned two possible future conditions.
* **Selection**: She selected a way to choose among options.
* **Decision**: She chose one of several alternative actions.
* **Planning**: She constructed a multistep action plan.
* **Reconsideration**: Later she reconsidered this choice.

**From other perspective:**

* **Learning**: She created descriptions and stored them away.
* **Recollecting**: She retrieved descriptions of prior events.
* **Embodiment**: She tried to describe her body’s condition.
* **Expression**: She constructed some verbal representations.
* **Narration**: She arranged these into storylike structures.
* **Intention**: She changed some goals and priorities.
* **Apprehension**: She was uneasy about arriving late.
* **Reasoning**: She made various kinds of inferences.

**Processes**

* **Reflection**: She thought about what she had recently done.
* **Self-Reflection**: She reflected on what she had thought about.
* **Empathy**: She imagined some other persons’ thoughts.
* **Reformulation**: She revised some of her representations.
* **Moral Reflection**: She evaluated what she has done.
* **Self-Awareness**: She characterized her mental condition.
* **Self-Imaging**: She made and used models of herself.
* **Sense of Identity**: She regarded herself as an entity.

###A-Brains and B-Brains

**A-Brain** gets some signals from the external world (via such organs as eyes, ears, nose, and skin)—and that it also can react to these by sending signals that make your muscles move. By itself, the A-Brain is a separate animal that only reacts to external events but has no sense of what they might mean.

**B-Brain** is connected so that it can react to signals that it receives from A, and then can react by sending signals to A. However, B has no direct connection to the outer world, so, like the prisoners in Plato’s cave, who see only shadows on a wall, the B-Brain mistakes A’s descriptions for real things. The B-Brain does not realize that what it perceives are not objects in the external world but are merely events in the A-Brain itself.

* What caused Joan to turn toward that sound? [**Instinctive**] 
* How did she know that it was the sound of a car? [**Learned**]
* What resources were used to make her decision? [**Deliberative**] 
* How did she choose which resources to use? [**Reflective**] 
* Did she feel that she made a good decision? [**Self-Reflective**] 
* Did her actions live up to her principles? [**Self-Conscious**]

**The Organism Principle**: When a system evolves to become more complex, this always involves a compromise: if its parts become too separate, then the system’s abilities will be limited—but if there are too many interconnections, then each change in one part will disrupt many others.

####Why Can’t We See How Our Own Minds Work?

Aaron Sloman 1992: "I, for one, do not think defining consciousness is important at all, and I believe that it diverts attention from important and difficult problems. The whole idea is based on a fundamental misconception that just because there is a noun ‘consciousness’ there is some ‘thing’ like magnetism or electricity or pressure or temperature, and that it’s worth looking for correlates of that thing. Or on the misconception that it is worth trying to prove that certain mechanisms can or cannot produce ‘it,’ or trying to find out how ‘it’ evolved, or trying to find out which animals have ‘it,’ or trying to decide at which moment ‘it’ starts when a fetus develops, or at which moment ‘it’ stops when brain death occurs, etc. There will not be one thing to be correlated but a very large collection of very different things."

In other words, we must try to design—as opposed to define—machines that can do what human minds do.

In this paradoxical view, consciousness still seems marvelous—not because it tells us so much, but because it protects us from so much tedious stuff!

Aaron Sloman 1992: "The phrase ‘human consciousness’ typically corresponds to such a large cluster of features and capabilities (many of which we don’t yet understand or know about) that its set of possible subsets is astronomical. There’s no point in expecting agreement on which subset is required for an animal or machine to be conscious, or asking when a human fetus first becomes conscious, or when a brain-damaged person is conscious, etc. A concept that is designed to work in various standard cases will just break down in non-standard cases, like ‘the time on the moon.’…And all those attempts to draw mythical lines will come to no more than a big waste of time—as opposed to researching the implications of all those different clusters of functions and coming up with a new and richer vocabulary."

However, there still are many scientists who seek to discover the "secret" of consciousness. They look for it in the waves of our brains, or in peculiar behaviors of certain cells, or in the mathematics of quantum mechanics. Why would those theorists hope to find one single concept, process, or thing to explain all those different aspects of minds? Perhaps that’s because they would prefer to have only one very large problem to solve—as opposed to dozens or hundreds of smaller ones.

Aaron Sloman 1994: "People are too impatient. They want a three-line definition of consciousness and a five-line proof that a computational system can or cannot have consciousness. And they want it today. They don’t want to do the hard work of unraveling complex and muddled concepts that we already have, and exploring new variants that could emerge from precisely specified architectures for behaving systems."

### How Do We Initiate Consciousness?

(1) They use the models we make of ourselves. (2) They tend to be more serial and less parallel. (3) They tend to use symbolic descriptions. (4) They make use of our most recent memories.

####Self-Models

We all construct mental models that describe our various mental states, bodies of knowledge about our abilities, depictions of our acquaintances, and collections of stories about our pasts. Then, whenever we use our models of ourselves, we tend to use terms like conscious when those reflections lead to choices we make, and we use unconscious or unintentional to describe those activities that we regard as beyond our control.

####Serial processes

The processes involved with walking, seeing, and talking take place in different parts of your brain, so they don’t need to compete for resources—whereas, for drawing a table and drawing a chair, you are likely to need to use the same higher-level resources to form and keep track of some intricate plans.

**The Parallel Paradox**: Whenever one splits a problem into parts and tries to think about them at once, one’s intellect will get dispersed and leave less cleverness for each task. The alternative is to sequentially apply one’s full mind to each of those parts—at the cost of consuming

#### Symbolic Descriptions

####Recent Memories: 

We usually think of consciousness as being about what’s happening now—that is, in the present, rather than in the past. However, it would always take some amount of time for any particular part of a brain or machine to find out what other parts have recently done. For example, suppose that someone asked, "Are you aware that you’re touching your ear?" You would not be able to reply until your language resources had time to react to signals from other parts of your brain that, in turn, have reacted to prior events.

#### How Do We Recognize Consciousness?

**The Immanence Illusion**: For most of the questions you would otherwise ask, some answers will have already arrived before the higher levels of your mind have had enough time to ask for them.

### Self-Models and Self-Consciousness

...Add self models picture 

Self-model she next will use; for example, if Joan has a model of the Critic called "CD" in Section 4-5, then she might say she made a conscious choice—if she can recall reflecting about that decision. However, if Joan does not happen to use such a model, then she might call her decision "unconscious" or "unintentional." Or alternatively, she might just say that she used "free will"—which might simply mean, "I have no model that explains how I made the choice I made."

### The Serial Stream of Consciousness

The world of subjective experience usually seems continuous, and we feel that we’re in the here and now, moving steadily into the future. Yet as we noted in Section 4-3, we can know about things that we’ve recently done, but cannot know what we are doing right now.

Daniel Dennett and Marcel Kinsbourne 1992: "[Remembered events] are distributed in both space and time in the brain. These events do have temporal properties, but those properties do not determine subjective order, because there is no single, definitive ‘stream of consciousness,’ only a parallel stream of conflicting and continuously revised contents. The temporal order of subjective events is a product of the brain’s interpretational processes, not a direct reflection of events making up those processes."

In fact, although people talk about being conscious of what is happening now, that’s the one thing you cannot be conscious of—because, as we have mentioned before, each brain resource can know, at most, only what a few others were doing some moments ago.
