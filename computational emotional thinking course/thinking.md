##Critic-Selector model of mind

Critic selector model.

![Cloud of resources](http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/E7/eb7_files/image002.png)

In most simple variant we could use one of those ways to think:

* If a problem seems familiar, Use reasoning by analogy.
* If it seems unfamiliar, Change the way you’re describing it.
* If it seems too difficult, Divide it into several parts.
* If it still seems difficult, Replace it by a simpler problem.
* If none of these work, Ask someone for help!

###Conflicts

1. Choose the resource with the highest priority.
1. Choose the one that is most strongly aroused.
1. Choose the one that gives the most specific advice.

####Reflective policies

1. If too many Critics are aroused, then describe the problem in more detail.
1. If too few Critics are aroused, then make the description more abstract.
1. If important resources conflict, then try to discover a cause for this.
1. If there has been a series of failures, then switch to a different set of Critics.

##Emotional thinking

Most of the time, your thinking proceeds in uneventful streams—but when you run into obstacles and none of your usual methods help, you may resort to mental strategies that may appear to be somewhat irrational. For example, when tempted to abandon your task, you can renew your motivation by bribing yourself with imagined rewards, or with threats of the prospect of failure—or you could try to shame yourself by imagining how you (or your Imprimers) might feel if your performance conflicted with your highest values. For even a brief flash of impatience, or of anger or desperation, can cut through what seems like a hopelessly tangled knot.

Damasio 1995: "One might say that the particular step of the task at which Elliot balked was actually being carried out too well, and at the expense of the overall purpose…. True, he was still physically capable and most of his mental capacities were intact. But his ability to reach decisions was impaired, as was his ability to make an effective plan for the hours ahead of him, let alone to plan for the months and years of his future."

##Useful ways to think

**Knowing How**. The best way to solve a problem is to already know a way to solve it. However, we may not be able to retrieve that knowledge—and often we don’t even know that we have it.

**Searching Extensively**. When one has no better alternative, one could try to search through all possible chains of actions. But that method is not often practical because such searches grow exponentially.

**Reasoning by Analogy**. When a problem reminds you of one that you solved in the past, you may be able to adapt that case to the present situation—if you have good ways to tell which similarities are most relevant.

**Dividing and Conquering**. If you can’t solve a problem all at once, then break it down into smaller parts. For example, every difference we recognize may suggest a separate subproblem to solve.

**Reformulating**. Find a different representation that highlights more relevant information. We often do this by making a verbal description—and then “understanding” it in some different way!

**Planning**. Consider the set of subgoals you want to achieve and examine how they affect each other. Then, with those constraints in mind, propose an efficient sequence for achieving them.

**Simplifying**. Often a good way to solve a difficult problem is first to solve a simpler version that ignores some features of that problem. Then any such solution may serve as a sequence of stepping-stones for solving the original problem.
**Elevating**. If you are bogged down in too many details, describe the situation in more general terms. But if your description seems too vague, switch to one that is more concrete.
**Changing the subject**. Whatever you are working on now, if you get discouraged enough, you can always abandon it and simply switch to a different task.

**Wishful thinking**. Imagine having unlimited time and all the resources that you might want. If you still can’t envision solving the problem, then you should reformulate it.

**Self-reflection**. Instead of further pursuing a problem, ask what makes that problem seem hard, or what you might be doing wrong. This can suggest some better techniques—or, instead, better ways to spend your time.

**Impersonation**. When your own ideas seem inadequate, imagine someone better at this, and try to do what that person would do. Myself, I do this frequently, by imitating Imprimers and teachers.

**Logical Contradiction**. Try to prove that your problem cannot be solved, and then look for a flaw in that argument.

**Logical Reasoning**. We often try to make chains of deductions. However, this can lead to wrong conclusions when our assumptions turn out to be unsound.2

**External Representations**. If you find that you’re losing track of details, you can resort to keeping records and notes, or drawing suitable diagrams.

**Imagination**. One can avoid taking physical risks if one can predict “What would happen if” by simulating possible actions inside the mental models that one has built.

**Cry for help**. You can behave in ways that may arouse your companions’ sympathies.

**Ask for help**. If your status is high enough, you can persuade or command someone else to help—or even offer to pay them.
