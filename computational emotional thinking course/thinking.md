In most simple variant we could use one of those ways to think:

* If a problem seems familiar, Use reasoning by analogy.
* If it seems unfamiliar, Change the way youâ€™re describing it.
* If it seems too difficult, Divide it into several parts.
* If it still seems difficult, Replace it by a simpler problem.
* If none of these work, Ask someone for help!
