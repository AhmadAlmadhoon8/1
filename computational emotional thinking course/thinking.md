Critic selector model.

In most simple variant we could use one of those ways to think:

* If a problem seems familiar, Use reasoning by analogy.
* If it seems unfamiliar, Change the way you’re describing it.
* If it seems too difficult, Divide it into several parts.
* If it still seems difficult, Replace it by a simpler problem.
* If none of these work, Ask someone for help!

###Conflicts

1. Choose the resource with the highest priority.
1. Choose the one that is most strongly aroused.
1. Choose the one that gives the most specific advice.

####Reflective policies

1. If too many Critics are aroused, then describe the problem in more detail.
1. If too few Critics are aroused, then make the description more abstract.
1. If important resources conflict, then try to discover a cause for this.
1. If there has been a series of failures, then switch to a different set of Critics.

##Emotional thinking

Most of the time, your thinking proceeds in uneventful streams—but when you run into obstacles and none of your usual methods help, you may resort to mental strategies that may appear to be somewhat irrational. For example, when tempted to abandon your task, you can renew your motivation by bribing yourself with imagined rewards, or with threats of the prospect of failure—or you could try to shame yourself by imagining how you (or your Imprimers) might feel if your performance conflicted with your highest values. For even a brief flash of impatience, or of anger or desperation, can cut through what seems like a hopelessly tangled knot.
