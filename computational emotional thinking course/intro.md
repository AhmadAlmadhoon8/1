##AI is the challenge.
First of all, let's think of AI challenges:

1. Biggest - we simply do not know what is natural intelligence.
1. Derivative: what is consciousness?
1. Derivative: what is thinking?
1. What is feeling (love)?
1. What is emotion? Why do we need emotions? What is emotional thinking?

##Some numbers
Biggest NN built so far - 2013 RIKEN created NEST NN, according to the is report there were 1.7 billon of neurons with ... trillion of synapses. Is it big enough? 

Human brain(typical) contains 86 billion of neurons.
Cat brain contains 1.5 billon neurons.

Consider energy consumption!
