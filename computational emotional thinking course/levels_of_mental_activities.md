#Levels of mental activities
Based on Marvin Minksy chapter of "The emotion machine"

##Everyday example

`Joan is starting to cross the street on the way to deliver her finished report. While thinking about what to say at the meeting, she hears a sound and turns her head—and sees a quickly oncoming car. Uncertain whether to cross or retreat but uneasy about arriving late, Joan decides to sprint across the road. She later remembers her injured knee and reflects upon her impulsive decision. “If my knee had failed, I could have been killed—and what would my friends have thought of me?”`

##Model of six

![Model of six](http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/E5/eb5_files/image001.png)

* **Inborn, Instinctive Reactions**: Joan hears a sound and turns her head. We are born with instincts that help us to survive.
* **Learned Reactions**: She sees a quickly oncoming car. Joan had to learn that certain conditions demand specific ways to react.
* **Deliberative Thinking**: What to say at the meeting. Joan considers several alternatives and tries to decide which would be best.
* **Reflective Thinking**: Joan reflects on her decision. Here she reacts not to external events but happenings inside her brain.
* **Self-Reflective Thinking**: Uneasy about arriving late. Here we find her thinking about plans that she has made for herself.
* **Self-Conscious Emotions**: What would my friends have thought of me? Here Joan asks how well her actions agreed with her ideals.

##Instinctive Reactions

* **IF** A THING TOUCHES YOUR SKIN, **DO** BRUSH IT AWAY.
* **IF** THAT DOESN’T WORK, **DO** MOVE YOUR BODY AWAY.
* **IF** A LIGHT IS TOO BRIGHT, **DO** TURN YOUR FACE AWAY.

##Learned Reactions

![Learned reactions](http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/E5/eb5_files/image005.png)

In any case, although many of our actions are based on inborn, instinctive reactions to things, we’re constantly developing new ways to react to situations—this requires a second layer for our model of how our brains are organized.

##Deliberative thinking

So using logic is somewhat like walking a plank; it assumes that each separate step is correct—whereas commonsense thinking demands more support; one must add evidence after every few steps.

##Reflective thinking

... we simply remember our earlier thoughts and then proceed to think about them. However, when we look more closely, we see that this requires a lot of machinery.

##Self-reflection

This could help you to recognize that you have lost track of what you were trying to do, or have been wasting time on minor details, or that you chose a poor goal to pursue. This could lead to your making a better plan—or might even lead to a large-scale cascade like, "Just thinking about this makes me feel ill. Perhaps it’s time to switch to some completely different activity."

##Self-conscious reflection

Joan must have built some models of the kinds of ideas that she "ought" to have. Then when she finds conflicts between how she behaves and the values of those to whom she’s attached, this could lead to the kinds of cascades we called "self-conscious emotions".

I agree that those boundaries are indistinct. Even one’s simplest deliberations may involve "self-reflective thoughts" about how to allocate one’s time and resources—as in, "If this doesn’t work, then I’ll have to try that," or "I have already spent too much time on it."
