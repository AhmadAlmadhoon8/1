#Levels of mental activities
Based on Marvin Minksy chapter of "The emotion machine"

##Everyday example

`Joan is starting to cross the street on the way to deliver her finished report. While thinking about what to say at the meeting, she hears a sound and turns her head—and sees a quickly oncoming car. Uncertain whether to cross or retreat but uneasy about arriving late, Joan decides to sprint across the road. She later remembers her injured knee and reflects upon her impulsive decision. “If my knee had failed, I could have been killed—and what would my friends have thought of me?”`

* **Inborn, Instinctive Reactions**: Joan hears a sound and turns her head. We are born with instincts that help us to survive.
* **Learned Reactions**: She sees a quickly oncoming car. Joan had to learn that certain conditions demand specific ways to react.
* **Deliberative Thinking**: What to say at the meeting. Joan considers several alternatives and tries to decide which would be best.
* **Reflective Thinking**: Joan reflects on her decision. Here she reacts not to external events but happenings inside her brain.
* **Self-Reflective Thinking**: Uneasy about arriving late. Here we find her thinking about plans that she has made for herself.
* **Self-Conscious Emotions**: What would my friends have thought of me? Here Joan asks how well her actions agreed with her ideals.

##Instinctive Reactions

* **IF** A THING TOUCHES YOUR SKIN, **DO** BRUSH IT AWAY.
* **IF** THAT DOESN’T WORK, **DO** MOVE YOUR BODY AWAY.
* **IF** A LIGHT IS TOO BRIGHT, **DO** TURN YOUR FACE AWAY.
