#Emotional thinking from bird eye view

##Definitions

**Antonio R. Damasio**: "Emotion in the perspective of an integrated nervous system" emphasized the effect of emotions: "The ultimate results of emotion are of two kinds. First there are behaviors — the expressing of joy, or anger, or disgust — which affect interactions with other living creatures. Second, there are experiences of emotional states, that is feelings, which affect the ongoing thinking of the subject and by so doing can alter future thinking, future planning and future behavior."

**Marvin Minsky**

Sometimes a person gets into a state where everything seems to be cheerful and bright—although nothing outside has actually changed. Other times everything pleases you less: the entire world seems dreary and dark, and your friends complain that you seem depressed. Why do we have such states of mind—or moods, or feelings, or dispositions—and what causes all their strange effects? Here are some of the phrases we find when dictionaries define emotion.

The subjective experience of a strong feeling. A state of mental agitation or disturbance. A mental reaction involving the state of one’s body.
A subjective rather than conscious affection. The parts of consciousness that involve feeling. A nonrational aspect of reasoning.

##Orchestra of emotions

Imagine the number of emotions we experience every day, every minute, starting from wake up in the morning till the late evening. Every action or significant change in environment is followed by emotional response. When we were kids and we could not control emotions expressions even wake up and washing the teeth was an emotional scene.


##Simple practical example

You have got the task on the timely basis: solve some problem in 15 minutes.

1. First of all you are calm and using some learned information to solve the problem.
1. When you realize that there is not that much time left, for example 5 minutes, you start feeling some anxiety and concentrate on the task.
1. Then you realize there is no time left, you start panic (for example :-)), and cry for help.

This is bright example of how do we use emotions in time control to change our actions strategy in everyday life. 

##The emotion machine (Model 6)

First starting point is the philosophy, we use Marvin Minsky book ["The emotion machine"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emotion_Machine).

Some ideas that I have reused here:

1. 6 mental activities levels model
1. Critic, Selector, Way to think triplet.
1. Consciousness and mind does not have "silver bullet" solution, there are several mechanisms that are always used and involved in the operation of the brain (intelligence).

Marvin Minsky question:

"What could make our brain grow?" In other words our ancestors monkeys that lived in some form till some moment 5 million years ago, what could trigger their brain to increase the frontal lobe? 

### Model 6

![model 6](http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/E5/eb5_files/image001.png)

1. `Inborn, Instinctive Reactions: Joan hears a sound and turns her head. All animals are born equipped with ‘instincts’ that help them to survive.`
1. `Learned Reactions: She sees a quickly oncoming car. Joan had to learn that conditions like this demand specific ways to react.`
1. `Deliberative Thinking: To decide what to say at the meeting, she considers several alternatives, and tries to decide which would be best.`
1. `Reflective Thinking: Joan reflects upon what she has done. She reacts, not just to things in things in the world, but also to recent events in her brain.`
1. `Self-Reflective Thinking: Being “uneasy about arriving late” requires her to keep track of the plans that she’s made for herself.`
1. `Self Conscious Emotions: When asking what her friends think of her, she also asks how her actions concord with ideals she has set for herself.`

Our practical examle in this model:

This is deliberatevly simplifed mapping of emotions to the "Model of six".

##Psychological view

Starting form Darwin.

* Fear/Terror - a frozen stare, a pale face, coldness, sweat, erect hair
