##Types of neurons according to neurotransmitter

1. **Cholinergic neurons—acetylcholine**. Acetylcholine is released from presynaptic neurons into the synaptic cleft. It acts as a ligand for both ligand-gated ion channels and metabotropic (GPCRs) muscarinic receptors. Nicotinic receptors, are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind nicotine. Ligand binding opens the channel causing influx of Na+ depolarization and **increases the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release**.
1. **GABAergic neurons—gamma aminobutyric acid**. GABA is one of two neuroinhibitors in the CNS, the other being Glycine. GABA has a homologous function to ACh, gating anion channels that allow Cl− ions to enter the post synaptic neuron. Cl− causes hyperpolarization within the neuron, **decreasing the probability of an action potential firing** as the voltage becomes more negative (recall that for an action potential to fire, a positive voltage threshold must be reached).
1. **Glutamatergic neurons—glutamate**. Glutamate is one of two primary **excitatory amino acids**, the other being Aspartate. Glutamate receptors are one of four categories, three of which are ligand-gated ion channels and one of which is a G-protein coupled receptor (often referred to as GPCR).
1. **Dopaminergic neurons—dopamine**. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that acts on D1 type (D1 and D5) Gs coupled receptors, which increase cAMP and PKA, and D2 type (D2, D3, and D4) receptors, which activate Gi-coupled receptors that decrease cAMP and PKA. Dopamine is connected to **mood and behavior**, and modulates both pre and post synaptic neurotransmission. Loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra has been linked to Parkinson's disease.
1. **Serotonergic neurons—serotonin**. Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) can act as **excitatory or inhibitory**. Of the four 5-HT receptor classes, 3 are GPCR and 1 is ligand gated cation channel.  A lack of 5-HT at postsynaptic neurons has been linked to depression. Drugs that block the presynaptic serotonin transporter are used for treatment, such as Prozac and Zoloft.

"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a common subject in biological experiments, has around 100,000 neurons and exhibits many complex behaviors. Many properties of neurons, from the type of neurotransmitters used to ion channel composition, are maintained across species, allowing scientists to study processes occurring in more complex organisms in much simpler experimental systems."
