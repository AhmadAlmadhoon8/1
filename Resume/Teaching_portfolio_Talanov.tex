\section{Administrative tasks relating to education}

\cvitem{}{\small Currently I have the position of the deputy director for science of the Information Technology and Information Systems institute (ITIS) of the Kazan Federal University, where I manage the research, grants and publication policies. For two years I was hearing two chairs in ITIS the Software engineering chair and Intellectual robotics chair during this period I have established the close collaboration with industrial companies to provide relevant and modern software expertise for students on highly demanded specializations. I take part in the academic committee of the KFU as well as ITIS institute.}

\section{Experience of study programmes, supervision and examinations}

\cvitem{}{\small While managing the Intelligent robotics chair I have built the research based department where students are involved in multidisciplinary research projects from the first day of their involvement in labs of the chair. This project training provided highly effective opportunity for students to start their scientific carrier. Majority of my students have their papers published in Scopus/Web of Science one of them has \href{https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56150559300}{\emph{h-index of 1.}} I have supervised thesis works of the students of my lab and the most significant result was the papers published with the involvement of the students during their thesis works presented in international conferences and journals. I have created and done the lecturing as well as supervision of the project for the following courses:}

\cvitem{2017-Now, Kazan Federal University}{\small \emph{Artificial intelligence}: the introduction in artificial intelligence including: machine learning and reinforcement learning, decision making, reasoning, knowledge bases and representations, natural language processing, intelligent agents. During the course students should develop the AI project using principles and technologies discussed in the course.}

\cvitem{2016-Now, Kazan Federal University; 2014-2015, Innopolis University}{\small \emph{Affective computation}: the extended view on the emotions and reimplementation in a computational system problem  including: philosophical, psychological, neurobiological and computational perspectives. The course starts from birds eye view on the problem, carries on to neurobiological details of a neuromodulation and psychological models of emotions, then progresses into philosophical questions of consciousness and thinking and ends up with cognitive architectures and spiking neural networks review. \href{https://github.com/max-talanov/1/blob/master/affective_computing_course/plan.md}{\emph{Course syllabus online}}.}

\cvitem{2014-2016, Kazan Federal University}{\small \emph{Software Design Architecture}: the course for bachelor students, intended to be starting point from basics of software design and UML to principles and design patterns, with extended use of practical examples. During the course students should develop project using principles of design studied. \href{https://github.com/max-talanov/1/blob/master/software_design_course/plan.md}{\emph{Course syllabus online}}.}
