	abstract = {In this paper we present the validation of the three-dimensional model of emotions by Hugo Lövheim the “cube of emotion” via neurosimulation in the NEST. We also present the extension of original “cube of emotion” with the bridge to computational processes parameters. The neurosimulation is done via re-implementation of DA, 5HT and NA subsystems of a rat brain to replicate 8 basic psycho-emotional states according to the “cube of emotion”. Results of neurosimulations indicate the incremental influence of DA and NA over computational resources of a psycho-emotional state while 5-HT decreases the computational resources used to calculate a psycho-emotional state. This way we indicate the feasibility of the bio-plausible re-implementation of psychoemotional states in a computational system. This approach could be useful extension of decision making and load balancing components of modern artificial agents as well as intelligent robotic systems.},
