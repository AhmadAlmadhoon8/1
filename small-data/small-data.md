#Small Data analysis system

##Abstract = 4 sentences

Observing tsunami of articles for new IT direction: "Small Data", including titles: "Forget Big Data, Small Data is the Real Revolution" and "How To Create Incredible Customer Service Through The 'Small Data' Advantage" for example on [Forbes.com](http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikekavis/2015/02/25/forget-big-data-small-data-is-driving-the-internet-of-things/), we face the rising interest of the human analogous data analysis. The challenging moment is the number of instances in disposal that we can not use statistical or machine learning methods instead neurobiologically inspired methods should be used. Using the model of mental activities known as cognitive architecture is the main tool to overcome the small data problem, and there is no "silver bullet" analysis method as humans are too multilateral in analysis and decision making that Small Data analysis framework is to be developed.

What is the main problem of small data ?

Why it matters and what can we do.

##The Problem = 1 page

Several last years big data was in the center of interest of and thus data scientist enjoyed the data centralization and integration in huge volumes. There are magnificent examples of big data analysis in use: Watson by IBM, "Human brain project", "Blue brain project". Slight shadow of hesitation run thought the face of some specialists asking the question do our brain work the same way and if not why not? It seems to be pretty good to process this amounts of exabytes and roll out resulting report. Unfortunately we have to live in the real time and usually we do not have time to run the exhaustive analysis, we have to make decisions here and now. That's why the other mechanism of quick decision making evolved. The other application field is the analysis of the big-data reports, currently there are human analysts that are doing this work in every industry for every major company for every more or less interesting filed and set of parameters.Still "the shoemaker's children go barefoot" in general we are unable to solve any even simple problem that somehow is connected to human understanding.

But demand is really high current robotics systems are not able of doing more or less reasonable reactions in complex social environment, analytical systems are capable of decision support in environment of the exabytes of data. IoT demands distributed decision making in real time that puts us into position of inventing of new methods and approaches.

First fact that biased our mindset is that brain contributes the 20 Watts only and still capable of much more that modern computational systems. Second is the decision making is done with much less data required for the training and still we tend to rely on human decision making much more than on machine with big data analysis. In medicine there are decision support systems that leaves final decision to human doctor.

As von Neumann architecture origins from human brain structure we again are looking into the neurobiological nature of the human mind. We gain our inspiration in research in neuroscience.

We propose combined approach based on:

1. Neurobiologically inspired reasoning
1. [Non axiomatic reasoning system](https://github.com/opennars/opennars)

###Neurobiologically inspired reasoning

We run the analysis of several psychological phenomena including emotions, decision making and consciousness based on the current state of neurobiological and psychological sources. As the result of our work we produced the semantic network of connected concepts, that is too complex to present here.
Main target of this analysis was the missing mechanisms in current AI solutions that could make analytical mechanisms more robust and flexible to gain an option proposing decision based on relatively small amount of data and in real-time.

System should be:
1. Alive:
    2. Capable of maintaining homeostasis
    2. Active 
1. Capable of synchronization of several events
1. Capable of association of events
1. Capable of self-training

All the items of the list above are not strait-forward and requires further definition:
System capacity for self-maintenance is crucial and should be developed in some extent in the computational system, for example there should be the mechanism of self-regulating of computational capacity redistribution, for robotic system self integrity maintenance, temperature, humidity and power consumption.

Active systems are more capable of outer wold exploration that is critical in system training [Oudeyer2013]. A computational system actively exploring and changing the world could be capable of self-training using options of virtual simulations, as for robotic system it should be capable of using physical playground.

Mammalian brain uses synchronization actively to combine the analytical events like detecting vertical and horizontal lines in visual stimulus.
