## Critic-Selector model of mind

![Critic-Selector](http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/E7/eb7_files/image001.png)

Critic selector model.

![Cloud of resources](http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/E7/eb7_files/image002.png)

In most simple variant we could use one of those ways to think:

* If a problem seems familiar, Use reasoning by analogy.
* If it seems unfamiliar, Change the way you’re describing it.
* If it seems too difficult, Divide it into several parts.
* If it still seems difficult, Replace it by a simpler problem.
* If none of these work, Ask someone for help!

### Conflicts

1. Choose the resource with the highest priority.
1. Choose the one that is most strongly aroused.
1. Choose the one that gives the most specific advice.

#### Reflective policies

1. If too many Critics are aroused, then describe the problem in more detail.
1. If too few Critics are aroused, then make the description more abstract.
1. If important resources conflict, then try to discover a cause for this.
1. If there has been a series of failures, then switch to a different set of Critics.

## Emotional thinking

Most of the time, your thinking proceeds in uneventful streams—but when you run into obstacles and none of your usual methods help, you may resort to mental strategies that may appear to be somewhat irrational. For example, when tempted to abandon your task, you can renew your motivation by bribing yourself with imagined rewards, or with threats of the prospect of failure—or you could try to shame yourself by imagining how you (or your Imprimers) might feel if your performance conflicted with your highest values. For even a brief flash of impatience, or of anger or desperation, can cut through what seems like a hopelessly tangled knot.

Damasio 1995: "One might say that the particular step of the task at which Elliot balked was actually being carried out too well, and at the expense of the overall purpose…. True, he was still physically capable and most of his mental capacities were intact. But his ability to reach decisions was impaired, as was his ability to make an effective plan for the hours ahead of him, let alone to plan for the months and years of his future."

## Useful Ways to Think

**Knowing How**. The best way to solve a problem is to already know a way to solve it. However, we may not be able to retrieve that knowledge—and often we don’t even know that we have it.

**Searching Extensively**. When one has no better alternative, one could try to search through all possible chains of actions. But that method is not often practical because such searches grow exponentially.

**Reasoning by Analogy**. When a problem reminds you of one that you solved in the past, you may be able to adapt that case to the present situation—if you have good ways to tell which similarities are most relevant.

**Dividing and Conquering**. If you can’t solve a problem all at once, then break it down into smaller parts. For example, every difference we recognize may suggest a separate subproblem to solve.

**Reformulating**. Find a different representation that highlights more relevant information. We often do this by making a verbal description—and then “understanding” it in some different way!

**Planning**. Consider the set of subgoals you want to achieve and examine how they affect each other. Then, with those constraints in mind, propose an efficient sequence for achieving them.

**Simplifying**. Often a good way to solve a difficult problem is first to solve a simpler version that ignores some features of that problem. Then any such solution may serve as a sequence of stepping-stones for solving the original problem.

**Elevating**. If you are bogged down in too many details, describe the situation in more general terms. But if your description seems too vague, switch to one that is more concrete.

**Changing the subject**. Whatever you are working on now, if you get discouraged enough, you can always abandon it and simply switch to a different task.
 
**Simulation**. One can avoid taking physical risks if one can predict “what would happen if” by imagining possible actions inside the mental models that one has built.

**Correlation**. When certain events seem to happen together, try to find ways in which they may be connected.

### Reflective Ways to Think

**Wishful thinking**. Imagine having unlimited time and all the resources that you might want. If you still can’t envision solving the problem, then you should reformulate it.

**Self-reflection**. Instead of further pursuing a problem, ask what makes that problem seem hard, or what you might be doing wrong. This can suggest some better techniques—or, instead, better ways to spend your time.

**Impersonation**. When your own ideas seem inadequate, imagine someone better at this, and try to do what that person would do. Myself, I do this frequently, by imitating Imprimers and teachers.

**Logical Contradiction**. Try to prove that your problem cannot be solved, and then look for a flaw in that argument.

**Logical Reasoning**. We often try to make chains of deductions. However, this can lead to wrong conclusions when our assumptions turn out to be unsound.

**External Representations**. If you find that you’re losing track of details, you can resort to keeping records and notes, or drawing suitable diagrams.

**Imagination**. One can avoid taking physical risks if one can predict “What would happen if” by simulating possible actions inside the mental models that one has built.

**Cry for help**. You can behave in ways that may arouse your companions’ sympathies.

**Ask for help**. If your status is high enough, you can persuade or command someone else to help—or even offer to pay them.

**Resignation**. Whenever you find yourself totally stuck, you can shut down the resources you’re using now and relax, lie back, drop out, and stop. Then the “rest of your mind” may find an alternative—or conclude that you don’t have to do this at all.

## Useful Types of Critics

**Innate Reactions and Built-in Alarms**. Many types of external events arouse detectors that make us quickly react—such as when an object rapidly moves toward you, or a light is too bright, or you touch something hot. We’re also born equipped with ways to detect certain conditions inside our skins—such as abnormal blood levels of chemicals—along with built-in connections that make us react to correct those conditions without any need to think about them.

**Learned Reactive Critics**. A typical infant will simply cry when exposed to high levels of noise—but later a child may learn to react by moving to a quieter place. And eventually we learn to deal with obstacles by using “deliberative” thinking about them.
 
**Deliberative Critics**. When our first attempt fails to solve a problem, we can often discover alternatives, by thinking about what might have gone wrong.

**Reflective Critics**. When you try to solve problems by trial and error, you use your critics as "diagnosticians"—either to verify that you’re making progress or to suggest alternative ways to proceed.

**Self-Reflective Critics**. When you can’t control the resources you need, or try to achieve too many goals at once, then you may start to criticize yourself:
 
* I have been too indecisive. (Try a method that worked on a similar problem.)
* I missed a good opportunity. (Switch to a different set of Critics.)
* I yield to too many distractions. (Try to exercise more self-control.)
* I don’t have all the knowledge I need. (Find a good book or go back to school.)
* This works so well that I should make myself better at it.

**Self-Conscious Critics**. Some assessments may even affect one’s current image of oneself, and this can affect one’s overall state:

* None of my goals seem meaningful.(Depression.)
* I’m losing track of what I am doing. (Confusion.)
* I can achieve any goal I like! (Mania.)
* I could lose my job if I fail at this. (Anxiety.)
* My friends might disapprove of this. (Insecurity.)
* This works so well that I should make it my specialty!

## Poincaré’s Unconscious Processes

* **Preparation**: activate resources to deal with this particular type of problem
* **Incubation**: generate many potential solutions
* **Revelation**: recognize a promising one
* **Evaluation**: verify that it actually works

## What if, or how we control the persistence of the processes

**What if your set of active Critics does not change**? Then you would likely keep repeating the same approach because, after each attempt to change your Way to Think, those Critics would try to switch you back again—and you might get stuck with a "one-track mind."

**What if some Critics stay on all the time**? Certain Critics must always be active to make us react to serious hazards—but if these are not selected carefully, it could lead to obsessive behaviors by making you focus too much of the time on only a few particular subjects.

**What if all your Critics get turned off**? Then all your questions would seem to be answered because you are no longer able to ask them, and all your problems would seem to be gone because nothing would seem to have any flaws.
 
**What if too many Critics are active at once**? Then you’d keep noticing flaws to correct and spending so much time repairing them that you would never get any important things done, and your friends may perceive you as depressed.

**What if too many Critics are turned off**? If you can ignore most alarms and concerns, that would help you to “concentrate,” but it also might lead you to ignore many errors and flaws. However, the fewer Critics you activate, the fewer goals you will try to pursue, and that could make you become too mentally dull.

**What if your Critics too often get switched**? Your thinking would become chaotic if too many goals were to freely compete without any larger-scale management.
