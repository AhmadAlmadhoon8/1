#Cube of emotions experiment description

## Stimulus to neuromodulators concentration tests
1. Run some series of impulses that simulate not loud sound in auditory cortex.
1. Run dopamine + serotonin neuromodulation that simulate reward.
1. Run two steps above for training.
1. Run step number one.
1. This should initiate dopamine + serotonin modulation based on training, if we observe rise of dopamine and serotonin concentration this should effectively indicate the association of dopamine neuromodulation with not loud sound as reward.

Same approach could be used for other neuromodulators of the "Cube of emotion" model: noradrenaline.
