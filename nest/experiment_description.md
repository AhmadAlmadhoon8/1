#Cube of emotions experiment description

##Computing power and memory distribution (attention)

###Description

1. Run some series of impulses that simulate **loud** sound in auditory cortex.
1. Run noradrenaline neuromodulation that simulate attention switch.
1. Run two steps above for training.
1. Run step number one.
1. This should initiate noradrenaline modulation based on training, if we observe rise of noradrenaline concentration this should effectively indicate the association of noradrenaline neuromodulation with **loud** sound.
1. Noradrenaline neuromodulation also should switch an attention in terms of computational processes concentrate the computing power and memory resources on the current processes associated with **loud** sound.

###Input

Series of impulses simulating **loud** sound.

###Output

1. Noradrenaline neuromodulation
1. Attention switch
1. Concentration of computational power and memory resources on thinking process associated with **loud** sound.

###Precondition

None

####Postcondition

Computational and memory resources are concentrated on current process associated with **loud** sound.


##Stimulation and reward processing 
1. Run some series of impulses that simulate **quite** sound in auditory cortex.
1. Run dopamine + serotonin neuromodulation that simulate reward.
1. Run two steps above for training.
1. Run step number one.
1. This should initiate dopamine + serotonin modulation based on training, if we observe rise of dopamine and serotonin concentration this should effectively indicate the association of dopamine neuromodulation with **quite** sound as reward.

Same approach could be used for other neuromodulators of the "Cube of emotion" model: noradrenaline.
