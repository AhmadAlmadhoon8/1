Each column receives feedforward sensory input from a different sensor array [e.g., different fingers or adjacent areas of the retina (not shown)]. The input layer combines sensory input with a modulatory location input to form sparse representations that correspond to features at specific locations on the object. The output layer receives feedforward inputs from the input layer and converges to a stable pattern representing the object (e.g., a coffee cup). Convergence in the second layer is achieved via two means. One is by integration over time as the sensor moves relative to the object, and the other is via modulatory lateral connections between columns that are simultaneously sensing different locations on the same object (blue arrows in upper layer). Feedback from the output layer to the input layer allows the input layer to predict what feature will be present after the next movement of the sensor.
