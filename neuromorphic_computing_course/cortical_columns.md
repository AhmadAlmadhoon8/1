Each column receives feedforward sensory input from a different sensor array [e.g., different fingers or adjacent areas of the retina (not shown)]. The input layer combines sensory input with a modulatory location input to form sparse representations that correspond to features at specific locations on the object. The output layer receives feedforward inputs from the input layer and converges to a stable pattern representing the object (e.g., a coffee cup). Convergence in the second layer is achieved via two means. One is by integration over time as the sensor moves relative to the object, and the other is via modulatory lateral connections between columns that are simultaneously sensing different locations on the same object (blue arrows in upper layer). Feedback from the output layer to the input layer allows the input layer to predict what feature will be present after the next movement of the sensor.

## Prediction with cortical columns 

![Prediction w cc](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/174222/fncir-10-00023-HTML/image_m/fncir-10-00023-g003.jpg)
(A) Both active cells (black) and depolarized/predicted cells (red) are shown. The first panel shows the unexpected input A, which leads to a prediction of the next input B′ (second panel). If the subsequent input matches the prediction then only the depolarized cells will become active (third panel), which leads to a new prediction (fourth panel). The lateral synaptic connections used by one of the predicted cells are shown in the rightmost panel. In a realistic network every predicted cell would have 15 or more connections to a subset of a large population of active cells. (B) Ambiguous sub-sequence “BC” (which is part of both ABCD and XBCY) is presented to the network. The first panel shows the unexpected input B, which leads to a prediction of both C′ and C″. The third panel shows the system after input C. Both sets of predicted cells become active, which leads to predicting both D and Y (fourth panel). In complex data streams there are typically many simultaneous predictions.
