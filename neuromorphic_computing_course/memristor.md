 In contrast to a linear (or non-linear) resistor the memristor has a dynamic relationship between current and voltage including a memory of past voltages or currents.

 Memristor resistance depends on the integral of the input applied to the terminals (rather than on the instantaneous value of the input as in a varistor).[3] Since the element "remembers" the amount of current that last passed through, it was tagged by Chua with the name "memristor".
