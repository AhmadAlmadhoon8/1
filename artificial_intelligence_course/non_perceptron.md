== Components ==

OpenCog consists of:

* A graph database that holds terms, atomic formulas, sentence (mathematical logic) and relational model as hypergraphs; giving them a probabilistic truth-value [interpretation, dubbed the [http://wiki.opencog.org/w/Atomspace AtomSpace].
* A satisfiability modulo theories solver, built in as a part of a generic graph query engine, for performing graph and hypergraph pattern matching (graph isomorphism).
* An implementation of a probabilistic reasoning engine based on probabilistic logic networks (PLN).
* A probabilistic genetic programming called Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search, or MOSES,<ref>http://wiki.opencog.org/w/MOSES</ref> originally developed by Moshe Looks who is now employed at Google.
* An attention allocation system based on economic theory, ECAN.<ref>http://wiki.opencog.org/w/ECAN</ref>
* An embodiment system for interaction and learning within [[virtual world]]s based in part on OpenPsi and Unity (game engine).
* A natural language input system consisting of Link Grammar and RelEx,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://opencog.org/wiki/RelEx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826042120/http://www.opencog.org/wiki/RelEx |archivedate=2009-08-26 |df= }}</ref> both of which employ AtomSpace-like representations for semantic and syntactic relations.
* A natural language generation system called SegSim,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://opencog.org/wiki/SegSim |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728174616/http://opencog.org/wiki/SegSim |archivedate=2009-07-28 |df= }}</ref> with implementations NLGen<ref>https://launchpad.net/nlgen</ref> and NLGen2.<ref>https://launchpad.net/nlgen2</ref>
* An implementation of Psi-Theory for handling emotional states, drives and urges, dubbed OpenPsi.<ref>http://opencog.org/wiki/OpenPsi{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
* Interfaces to Hanson Robotics robots, including emotion modelling<ref>http://wiki.hansonrobotics.com/w/Emotion_modeling</ref> via OpenPsi.
